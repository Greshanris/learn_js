## Object Oriented Programming

## Object
- Collection of ``properties`` and ``methods`` (**Properties** can be variable or can also be referred as constants while **methods** are functions that returns certain values.)
- For instance, *toLowerCase*

## Why use OOP?
- To make code reusable
- To not mess up things later on.
- To use certain new features.

## Parts of Object Oriented Programming:
**Object Literal**
- It literally means we are taking Object which has its own attributes and behaviours that identifies it as that particular object.

**Keywords we are going to use**
- *Constructor function*
- *Prototypes*
- *Classes*
- *Instances*

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction
    - for hiding internal details
    - for example, fetch() will hide how network is being called.
- Encapsulation
    - Wrapping up the data or encapsulates the data
- Inheritance
    - 
- Polymorphism
    - One method doing different works
