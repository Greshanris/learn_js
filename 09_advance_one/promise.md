# Promise

The ``Promise`` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and it's resulting value.

## which operation can be known as ``Promise``?
- Network operations
- Reading file from the systems
- Getting Data from the Datbase which may be in another continent.

We can use any ranging from ``async.wait`` to ``Promise``but most of the time whether in mobile development, mostly ``Promise`s are used.

## ``Promise`` is in one of these states:
- **Pending:** Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled:** Meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
- **Rejected:** Meaning that the operation failed.
